Description: An R implementation of the Dynamic Topic Model (DTM) based on the 
    tomotopy C++ code. DTM allows tracking how topics evolve over time in a 
    document collection by modeling each time slice with its own topic model,
    while ensuring smooth topic evolution between adjacent time slices. This 
    package provides functions for creating, training, and analyzing dynamic
    topic models, as well as visualization tools for exploring topic evolution.
